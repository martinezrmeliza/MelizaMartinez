   		<td>[Piece 1: With this piece I attempted to create a pop art inspired artwork using a celebrity photo. I am most proud of this piece because I believe that its bright colors depict the visual in being used by the eye-catching vibrant colors.] </td>
   		<td>[Piece 2: In this piece I created a visual design campaign that references a social justice topic of the refugee crisis. The design was especially challenging here because trying to choose and combine all these photos that reference the refugee crisis proved to require my thinking of how I was going to make a new scene made from different photos to create more awareness within society.] </td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: This piece was inspired by fantastic beasts and mythological creatures. In the multiplicity of materials used, I created a fantastical beast composite using images of different pre-existing animals and combining them together. I tried to use three different animals that I wanted to turn into a hybrid creature.] </td>
